                    She can speak English, Bangla, French and Japanese. Speaking different languages has helped her broaden her communication skills and learn to appreciate other cultures and traditions.

                <p class="bio">
                    Marc is pursuing a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida. He speaks 5 languages: Catalan, Spanish, English, German and French.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He grew up in Catalonia, where both Catalan and Spanish are official languages. He learned both languages as a result, but considers Catalan to be his mother tongue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He decided to learn German at age 14, guided by his interest in engineering. Since Germany is a nexus for engineering in Europe, he knew he would eventually need to speak German to communicate with his colleagues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He ended up pursuing a master’s degree in Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His best experience with the language? He is proud of defending his master’s thesis in German—followed closely by the first time he dreamt in German while living abroad. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His advice to language learners: “Practice, practice, practice. Don’t be shy; even if you aren’t totally confident, speaking is how I learned the most.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marc used German to advance his engineering career. It just goes to show that if you can dream it, then you can do it. And if you’re lucky, you might even dream it in German.

                <p class="bio">
                    Irene is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Mass Communications. She speaks Spanish, English, Catalan, French and a bit of German. A native Spanish speaker, she learned English and French in school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She started learning Catalan when she began dating her husband from Tarragona, since he spoke with his friends and family in Catalan. 
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Learning languages has opened up many opportunities for her. She has studied in the United States in two different stints. Catalan has helped her grow closer with her husband’s family and friends. She has also found apologizing in Catalan an effective tool for placating an angry husband.  
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    Her advice to language learners: immerse yourself in the language. Her English improved considerably when she started watching TV and reading books in English. For those looking to learn English, she found “Friends” to be a valuable resource.
